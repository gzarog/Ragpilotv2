# Contributing to RAGpilot

## Development setup

RAGpilot targets Python 3.12+.

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This installs the package in editable mode plus the dev toolchain
(`pytest`, `ruff`, `mypy`).

## Running the checks

```bash
pytest -q                 # tests
ruff check .               # lint
mypy src/ragpilot           # type-check
```

All three must pass before opening a pull request; CI runs the same checks
across Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### The `docling_pdf` marker

Docling's PDF pipeline (layout detection, table structure) downloads model
weights from Hugging Face on first use. That is a real network dependency,
so tests that actually invoke it are marked `@pytest.mark.docling_pdf` and
excluded from the default run (`pyproject.toml`'s `addopts` runs
`-m 'not docling_pdf'`). Run them explicitly:

```bash
pytest -m docling_pdf -q
```

Every other Phase 3 format (DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, HTML, Markdown, TXT, EML) is
converted by Docling's rule-based backends and never touches that
download path, so those tests run in the default suite like everything
else. CI runs `docling_pdf` tests too, but in a separate,
non-blocking (`continue-on-error`) job -- see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

#### What `docling_pdf` actually proves for PDF

PDF is not normalized straight off Docling's PDF pipeline output. After
that real pipeline produces its `DoclingDocument`, `docling_adapter
.convert` exports it to Markdown, caches the Markdown text by the file's
content hash (`document_conversion_cache`, a project's `knowledge.db`),
and reparses that Markdown through Docling's separate, rule-based
Markdown backend into the document that is actually normalized/chunked/
indexed -- see `docling_adapter.py`'s module docstring for the full
rationale. `pytest -m docling_pdf` is what actually exercises this: it
proves the real pipeline's Markdown export round-trips correctly through
a reparse (`test_pdf_converts_to_a_paragraph_with_page_provenance`), that
a first `convert()` call against a project connection populates the
cache, and that a second `convert()` call against that same connection
reuses the cached Markdown without ever touching the PDF-pipeline
singleton again (`test_convert_caches_markdown_by_content_hash`/
`test_convert_reuses_cached_markdown_without_reconverting`). The marker-
based page-number reconstruction this round-trip requires (reparsed
items carry no `prov`) is proven separately, without any real PDF or
model, in `tests/unit/test_document_normalizer.py`'s
`test_page_break_marker_reconstructs_page_numbers_without_prov` -- that
one runs in the default suite.

### The `daemon_subprocess` marker

`ragpilot daemon start`/`stop` spawn and signal a real, detached OS
process (Phase 7). That is slower and more platform-fragile than
anything else in the suite (process startup time, signal delivery, PID
reuse), so tests that actually spawn a process are marked
`@pytest.mark.daemon_subprocess` and excluded from the default run the
same way `docling_pdf` is (`addopts` runs
`-m 'not docling_pdf and not daemon_subprocess'`). Run them explicitly:

```bash
pytest -m daemon_subprocess -q
```

The daemon *loop* itself -- watcher wiring, debounce, periodic
reconciliation, offline/online transitions, graceful shutdown, PID-file
and health-snapshot bookkeeping -- is fully covered by direct unit/
integration tests (`test_daemon.py`, `test_service_pid.py`,
`test_service_health.py`, `test_watcher_local.py`,
`test_watcher_network.py`) that never spawn a process, so this marker
only guards the process-spawning/signaling plumbing around it. CI runs
`daemon_subprocess` tests too, in the same style as `docling_pdf`: a
separate, non-blocking (`continue-on-error`) job -- see
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

### The `embedding_model` marker

Phase 9's local semantic search (`retrieval/embedder.py`) loads a real
`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model via `transformers`, which
downloads and caches its weights from Hugging Face on first use -- the
same real-network-dependency shape as `docling_pdf`'s model download, so
it gets the same treatment: tests that actually load the model are
marked `@pytest.mark.embedding_model` and excluded from the default run
(`pyproject.toml`'s `addopts`). Run them explicitly:

```bash
pytest -m embedding_model -q
```

Everything else in Phase 9 -- vector storage/cosine similarity
(`retrieval/vectorstore.py`), the `embeddings` table repository, semantic
search's degrade-gracefully paths, and the AI provider abstraction -- is
tested with precomputed/fake vectors and mocked HTTP, and runs in the
default suite. CI runs `embedding_model` tests too, in the same style as
`docling_pdf`: a separate, non-blocking (`continue-on-error`) job -- see
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

### The `benchmark_search` marker and `benchmarks/search/`

The search performance redesign's benchmark suite (`benchmarks/search/`,
a top-level package alongside `src/` and `tests/` -- see its own
docstring) generates a synthetic corpus directly through the storage
repositories (no Tree-sitter/Docling parsing, no real embedding model)
and measures real query latency against it. Its pytest coverage
(`tests/integration/test_search_benchmarks.py`) is marked
`@pytest.mark.benchmark_search` and excluded from the default run the
same way `docling_pdf`/`daemon_subprocess`/`embedding_model` are, since
its millisecond numbers are only meaningful on real, unshared hardware
(a busy CI runner missing a target is not a regression signal -- see
`benchmarks/search/targets.py`). Run it explicitly:

```bash
pytest -m benchmark_search -q -s
```

That runs the fast `small` (5k-embedding) corpus size. Larger sizes
(`medium`/`large`/`very_large`, per the blueprint's own suggested
scale) are opt-in, both for the pytest coverage and the standalone
script:

```bash
RAGPILOT_BENCHMARK_SIZE=medium pytest -m benchmark_search -q -s
python -m benchmarks.search --size large --strict
```

`--strict` is the form that actually enforces the blueprint's
performance targets (section 36) -- meant for a real developer machine,
not CI, which runs `benchmark_search` tests in the same non-blocking
style as `docling_pdf`/`embedding_model` (see `.github/workflows/
ci.yml`) and only asserts the pipeline itself works (every category
finds its known fixture), never the wall-clock numbers.

Search *quality* (not speed) has a separate, always-on regression test:
`tests/integration/test_search_quality.py` indexes a small, fixed
fixture project through the real CLI pipeline and evaluates every query
in `benchmarks/search/golden_queries.yaml` (blueprint section 37) via
Recall@5/@10, MRR, and NDCG@10 (`benchmarks/search/quality.py`) --
this one *does* run in the default suite, since it is fast, offline,
and deterministic.

### The install scripts (`install.sh` / `install.ps1`)

`install.sh` and `install.ps1` at the repo root are what `README.md`'s
`curl | sh` / `irm | iex` one-liners run. They download a branch/tag
tarball or zipball from GitHub (`RAGPILOT_REF`, default `main`), create a
venv, `pip install` the package into it, and link/launch `ragpilot` from a
per-user bin directory (`RAGPILOT_BIN_DIR`, `RAGPILOT_INSTALL_DIR` to
override). Run them locally exactly as CI does, pointed at a branch:

```bash
RAGPILOT_REF=my-branch RAGPILOT_INSTALL_DIR=/tmp/ragpilot-install RAGPILOT_BIN_DIR=/tmp/ragpilot-bin sh ./install.sh
/tmp/ragpilot-bin/ragpilot version
```

```powershell
$env:RAGPILOT_REF = "my-branch"; ./install.ps1
```

Like `docling_pdf`/`embedding_model`, this repeats a real network fetch
plus torch/docling's dependency download, so CI runs it in a separate,
non-blocking (`continue-on-error`) job across all three OSes -- see
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Test isolation

Every test must isolate RAGpilot's runtime directory via the `RAGPILOT_HOME`
environment variable (see the `ragpilot_home` fixture in `tests/conftest.py`)
and a `tmp_path`-based current working directory where project config or
source files are involved. Tests must never read or write the real
`~/.ragpilot` directory.

## Project layout

- `src/ragpilot/cli/` — Typer CLI commands
- `src/ragpilot/core/` — config, paths, models, errors, app lifecycle
- `src/ragpilot/sources/` — source registry, scanning, ignore rules, hashing
- `src/ragpilot/storage/` — SQLite connection handling, schema, migrations, repositories
- `src/ragpilot/indexing/` — scan/classify/enqueue/process orchestration
- `src/ragpilot/code/` — Tree-sitter parsing, extraction, resolution, framework heuristics
- `src/ragpilot/documents/` — Docling adapter, normalization, chunking, metadata
- `src/ragpilot/retrieval/` — lexical/semantic search, graph traversal, context budgeting
- `src/ragpilot/ai/` — LLM provider abstraction for `ragpilot ask` (Phase 9)
- `src/ragpilot/telemetry/` — structured logging
- `src/ragpilot/security/` — path containment and secret-file exclusion

This repository is built out in sequential phases (see `README.md`); please
keep changes scoped to the phase you are working on rather than adding
speculative structure for later phases.

## Document fixtures

`tests/fixtures/documents/` holds committed, hand-verified fixtures for
Phase 3's golden tests (`simple.txt`, `simple.md`, `simple.html`,
`sample.eml`, `corrupt.docx`, `sample.pdf` by hand; `document.docx`,
`presentation.pptx`, `spreadsheet.xlsx` generated). Regenerate the latter
with:

```bash
python tests/fixtures/documents/generate_fixtures.py
```

## Commit style

Keep commits focused and describe the "why" as well as the "what". Update
`CHANGELOG.md` under "Unreleased" for user-visible changes.
