"""Real OpenAI Chat Completions client (the ``openai`` PyPI package).

``pyproject.toml`` pins ``openai>=1.0,<2``: the well-documented, stable
v1.x ``OpenAI(...).chat.completions.create(...)`` surface, built on plain
``httpx`` -- confirmed against the actual installed package rather than
assumed, since this environment's PyPI index also serves a much newer
major (3.x) that vendors its own forked HTTP client internally and would
undermine the "inject a fake ``httpx.Client``" testing approach below.
