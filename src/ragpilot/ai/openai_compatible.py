"""A generic OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint (self-hosted or
third-party), reusing the OpenAI SDK itself pointed at a configurable
``base_url`` -- "OpenAI-compatible" means exactly that: the same
``POST {base_url}/chat/completions`` request/response shape ``ai/openai.py``
already speaks, so a second hand-rolled HTTP client would just duplicate
it. What's actually different from ``ai/openai.py`` is the two things
this module owns: ``base_url`` is required (there is no sensible default
for an arbitrary endpoint), and the API key comes from a different,
generic environment variable rather than ``OPENAI_API_KEY``, since this
is deliberately not OpenAI's own service.
