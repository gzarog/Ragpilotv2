"""Provider-agnostic interface for Phase 9's ``ragpilot ask``.

Deliberately minimal, per the blueprint's own framing: a provider is a
*consumer* of evidence Phase 5 already assembled (``retrieval/
context_builder.py`` via ``cli/explore.py``'s ``_run``), never a second
knowledge-model owner -- nothing here reads a database, resolves a
symbol, or ranks anything. Every concrete provider
(``ai/openai.py``/``anthropic.py``/``ollama.py``/``openai_compatible.py``)
implements exactly one method: turn an ``AiRequest`` into an ``AiAnswer``.
