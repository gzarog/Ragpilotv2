"""CRUD for ``cross_links`` (Phase 4 cross-domain facts) in a project's
``knowledge.db``.

Unlike ``entities_repo``/``documents_repo``, there is no "regenerate this
file's rows" bulk-insert entry point here: cross-domain links are
produced one at a time by ``knowledge/linker.py`` (auto-discovered) or
``cli/link.py`` (explicit, user-defined). ``delete_by_entity_file``/
``delete_by_document_file`` give the two owning repositories (and
``files_repo.delete``) a way to cascade-clean stale links before their
own generational delete, mirroring the pattern they already use for
``code_fts``/``document_fts``.
