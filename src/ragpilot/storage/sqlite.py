"""SQLite connection factory and transaction helper.

WAL + a busy timeout let a reader and the single writer coexist without
"database is locked" errors under normal CLI usage; NORMAL synchronous is
the standard WAL pairing (still durable across app crashes, only an OS
crash can lose the last commit) traded for far less fsync overhead.
``temp_store = MEMORY`` keeps FTS5/sort/join scratch space (e.g. a large
``ORDER BY``) off disk, and a configurable page cache (blueprint section
22) trades RAM for fewer page reads on repeated queries against the same
database.
