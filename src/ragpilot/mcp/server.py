"""Builds the stdio MCP server (blueprint: "MCP over stdio as the default
agent transport, no external listening port"). ``build_server`` is pure
construction -- no I/O, no blocking loop -- so it is unit-testable on its
own; ``run_stdio`` is the actual blocking entrypoint ``cli/serve.py`` calls.

Uses the high-level ``mcp.server.fastmcp.FastMCP`` API: decorator/registry-
style tool registration with input/output schemas derived from typed
Python signatures and the ``schemas.py`` Pydantic models, rather than the
low-level ``mcp.server.lowlevel.Server`` API's hand-written JSON-RPC
handlers -- simpler and directly testable (a FastMCP tool is just the
underlying Python coroutine, see ``mcp/tools.py``'s docstring).
