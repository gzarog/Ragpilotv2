"""Resolves raw extracted references (call/inherit/import targets, given
only as text) into confidence-scored links to known entities.

Confidence rule -- the non-obvious design decision this module encodes:

  EXACT     A single, unambiguous match within the SAME file as the
            reference. Same-file resolution never depends on guessing
            across a project's naming conventions, so an unambiguous hit
            here is as certain as this generic (no type-inference)
            resolver gets.
  HIGH      Either (a) more than one same-file candidate shares the bare
            name (still same file, so still trustworthy, just not
            provably unambiguous), or (b) a different file in the same
            project has an entity whose *qualified* name exactly equals
            the reference text -- an exact qualified-name match is a
            strong signal even across files.
  MEDIUM    Resolution fell back to a bare name only (no qualification),
            possibly matching more than one candidate project-wide, or
            found no candidate at all. Per the blueprint, an unresolved
            reference is still recorded -- pointing at ``target_symbol``
            rather than an entity id -- rather than being dropped, and
            MEDIUM is the tier for that "low confidence, kept anyway"
            case (see relationships_repo.incoming_by_symbol).
  HEURISTIC Reserved for framework_rules.py. Never assigned here: nothing
            in this module goes beyond a generic name/qualified-name
            match, so nothing it produces is a framework heuristic.
