"""One consistent way to look up a known entity -- code or document -- by
id or by canonical/qualified name, within a single project's
``knowledge.db``.

A query facade, not a new persistence layer: every function here wraps
``entities_repo``/``documents_repo``/``files_repo`` (already Phase 2/3's
storage access points) rather than reading tables directly. ``cli/link.py``
uses this to resolve what a person typed on the command line; Phase 5's
context builder is expected to build on the same functions rather than
re-implementing "is this a code id or a document id" dispatch.

Scope: one project (``knowledge.db``) at a time, matching Phase 2/3's own
per-project connection scoping -- code/graph.py's ``all_project_connections``
is what a caller reaches for when a lookup needs to span every registered
source (e.g. ``cli/link.py`` iterating sources to disambiguate a name).
