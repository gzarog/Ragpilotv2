"""Cross-domain linker: connects code entities to the documents that
describe them (blueprint section 19, "Cross-Domain Linking").

Confidence ladder -- extends Phase 2's ``Confidence``
(``core/models.py``), same comment style as ``code/resolver.py``:

  EXACT      Never assigned by this module. Reserved for an explicit,
             user-defined mapping (``ragpilot link add``, see
             ``cli/link.py``) -- the highest-trust source, and per the
             blueprint the automated linker must never override or
             contradict a fact a person pinned by hand. This module has
             no code path that writes ``resolver="user"``, so it
             structurally cannot produce an EXACT link.
  HIGH       An exact or qualified identifier match: the entity's bare
             name or fully-qualified name appears verbatim in a
             document's heading/paragraph/table text. The blueprint asks
             for qualified matches to be "at least as strong as" bare
             matches, not a separate tier, so both are scored HIGH here;
             they differ instead in relationship type (see below) and in
             their ``resolver`` string, which keeps them distinguishable
             for audit without inventing a fifth confidence tier.
  MEDIUM     A weaker structural signal: the document names the entity's
             source filename, or a short alias of its qualified name
             (its final two dotted segments, dropping the namespace
             prefix) -- plausible, not identifier-precise.
  HEURISTIC  A framework-pattern route match, reusing Phase 2's
             ``framework_rules``-tagged HTTP endpoint findings. A naming-
             convention guess, never a language fact -- exactly the rule
             ``framework_rules.py`` itself already applies to those
             findings, just carried through to their document side too.

Relationship type marks *how strong a claim* a match is, independent of
confidence: ``DOCUMENTED_BY`` for a qualified-name match (this document
is very likely specifically about this entity), ``MENTIONED_IN`` for a
weaker/generic mention (bare name, filename, alias), ``RELATED_TO`` as
the catch-all for an ambiguous/heuristic match (route findings). Only
these three of the blueprint's relationship catalog are populated here --
PRODUCES/CONSUMES/DEPENDS_ON/REQUIRES/TESTED_BY/AFFECTS/SUPERSEDES have no
real signal in what Phases 1-3 extract.

Semantic similarity is deliberately never a source here (blueprint
sections 19 and 57): it may only ever *suggest* a link for a human to
confirm, never mint a confidence-scored fact on its own -- and Phase 4
has no embedding infrastructure to do so anyway (that is Phase 9).
