"""Normalizes any relationship-shaped fact -- a Phase 2 code relationship
or a Phase 4 cross-domain link -- into the blueprint's evidence contract
(section 57): a flat, source-labelled, location-carrying shape that Phase
5's context builder and Phase 6's MCP tools can consume without caring
whether the underlying fact came from the code graph or the document
store.

A thin mapper, not a new store: Phase 2/3 already keep enough location/
provenance on ``Entity``/``Relationship``/``DocumentUnit`` rows to
populate this at read time from ``entities_repo``/``relationships_repo``/
``documents_repo`` directly, so nothing here is persisted. See
``core.models.CrossLink``'s docstring for why cross-domain *links*
themselves still get one small dedicated table (``cross_links``) --
that's a storage-shape problem (a document is not an ``entities`` row),
unrelated to this module's job of shaping already-stored facts for
display.
