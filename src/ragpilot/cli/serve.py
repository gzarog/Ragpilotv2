"""``ragpilot serve --mcp`` -- start the stdio MCP server.

``--mcp`` is required and is (deliberately) the only transport this phase
implements; the optional local REST API (``api:`` config section) is
Phase 8's job. This command only checks ``mcp.enabled`` and hands off to
the blocking stdio loop -- server construction itself lives in
``mcp/server.py`` and is unit-tested there, independent of this command.
