"""PID-file bookkeeping for ``ragpilot daemon start|stop|restart|status``.

This lets a *separate* CLI invocation (``daemon stop``/``status``, run
later, in a different process) find and signal the actual running daemon
process. It does not, by itself, prevent two daemons from starting --
Phase 1's ``RunLock`` (reused unchanged for each of the daemon's
indexing passes, see ``service/daemon.py``) is what already prevents two
writers from corrupting the same database; this module only adds what a
*different* process needs in order to locate and signal the one that is
running, matching the blueprint's "only add what's needed to find/signal
a different running process" scope.
