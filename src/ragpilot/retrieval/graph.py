"""Retrieval-layer composition over Phase 2's ``code/graph.py`` BFS.

Nothing here reimplements graph walking -- ``code/graph.py``'s ``traverse``/
``traverse_symbol``/``find_symbol_matches`` already give a depth- and
result-capped, deterministically ordered BFS, exactly what the blueprint
asks Phase 5's ``impact`` to reuse rather than growing its own. This
module adds the two things Phase 2's CLI commands didn't need:

1. ``references`` -- the incoming+outgoing CALLS/IMPORTS/REFERENCES merge
   ``cli/references.py`` used to inline. Extracted here so
   ``cli/references.py``, ``cli/impact.py`` and ``cli/explore.py`` share
   one implementation instead of three copies of the same aggregation.
2. Edge *resolution* (``resolved_incoming``/``resolved_outgoing``) --
   ``impact``/``explore`` need each edge's neighboring entity and file,
   not just the raw ``Relationship`` row, to report caller/callee/test
   names and locations.
3. ``is_test_file``/``find_tests_referencing`` -- the small, documented
   naming-convention heuristic behind the "tests" signal in both
   ``impact`` and ``explore``.
