"""Brute-force cosine similarity, RAGpilot's chosen "equivalent embedded
index" (blueprint section 53) in place of a loadable SQLite extension
like sqlite-vec.

Why brute-force over sqlite-vec: ``sqlite3.Connection.enable_load_extension``
is not guaranteed available or enabled on every platform/Python build
(some distro/Homebrew/Windows builds ship SQLite without extension-
loading compiled in at all), and this project has already been burned by
exactly this class of cross-platform SQLite risk in earlier phases (see
CHANGELOG's Phase 5-7 Windows/macOS-specific fixes) -- without a live
multi-OS test to confirm it, wiring in a loadable extension is a real,
unverifiable portability gamble. A plain linear scan has no such risk,
needs no native binary, and is entirely adequate at the scale a local
per-project knowledge base actually holds (thousands, not millions, of
entities/document sections) -- exactly the tradeoff the blueprint itself
sanctions ("sqlite-vec *or equivalent*").

Deliberately pure Python (no numpy): this module is the one piece of
Phase 9 that must stay importable and fast in the *default* test suite
without the real embedding model or its ``torch``/``transformers``
dependency -- see the module docstring split in ``retrieval/embedder.py``.
