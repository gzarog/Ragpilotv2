"""Approximate Nearest Neighbor semantic search (blueprint sections
12/30/32): a persistent, incrementally-updated index so ``retrieval/
semantic.py`` no longer scores a query against every current-model
embedding in the project on every search.

``AnnIndex`` is a small protocol two backends satisfy:

* ``USearchAnnIndex`` -- the production backend, backed by the
  ``usearch`` package's HNSW index, persisted to
  ``<project>/vectors.usearch``.
* ``BruteForceAnnIndex`` -- an in-memory fallback with the exact same
  interface, used when ``usearch`` can't be imported (unsupported
  platform, broken install) or when ``search.vector.engine`` is
  explicitly set to ``"bruteforce"``. It has nothing to persist: its
  vectors already live in ``embeddings``/``vector_items`` (SQLite stays
  authoritative either way, per blueprint section 49), so ``save``/
  ``load`` are no-ops.

``hnswlib`` (the blueprint's suggested second choice) is deliberately
not wired in as a third backend: ``usearch`` -> brute-force is already a
two-tier "fast path, always-correct fallback" that never leaves semantic
search unavailable, and maintaining a second native HNSW binding for a
case ``usearch``'s own wheel coverage doesn't already handle would add a
real maintenance surface for no observed gap (see the package's PyPI
wheel matrix: linux/macOS/Windows, x86_64/arm64, cp310-cp314). The
``AnnIndex`` protocol keeps that swap possible later without touching
any caller.
