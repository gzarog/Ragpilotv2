"""Hybrid candidate merge (blueprint section 22): combines
``retrieval/lexical.py``'s ranked results and ``retrieval/semantic.py``'s
similarity hits into one deduplicated candidate set per ``(kind, id)``,
tracking which signal(s) found each one -- the input ``retrieval/
reranker.py`` reranks into a single ordered list.

Deliberately a separate step from ``lexical.py``'s own ``_merge``: that
function only ever sees lexical evidence and stays untouched (its
existing dedup/tiering behavior, and every test pinned to it, keeps
working exactly as before) -- this module is the *additional* hybrid
view ``ragpilot search`` builds on top, not a replacement for it.
