"""Hybrid reranking (blueprint section 21): turns ``retrieval/merger.py``'s
deduplicated candidates into one final ordered list, composed exactly as
the blueprint specifies -- ``primary_tier + secondary_score +
tie_breakers`` -- while preserving deterministic lexical precedence
(section 57's "no half-finished implementation" of "never let semantic
similarity silently upgrade an exact lexical tier").

A candidate found only via semantic search sorts into its own tier
*below every lexical tier* (``_SEMANTIC_ONLY_TIER``), ranked among
itself by score; a candidate found via both keeps its lexical tier as
the primary signal, with its semantic score folded in only as a
same-tier tie-breaker. Ties beyond that fall back to the exact
tie-breaker chain ``lexical.py``'s own ``_sort_key`` already
established (entity kind, recency, source, path, id), so identically
lexically-tiered results keep the ordering users already see today.
