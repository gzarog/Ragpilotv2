"""Query result and query-embedding caching (blueprint sections 23/24).

Both caches are process-local (plain module-level state): ``ragpilot
search``/``ragpilot explore`` are one-shot CLI invocations, a fresh
process per call, so an in-memory cache there is created and discarded
with nothing to show for it. The actual beneficiary is any process that
serves *repeated* queries within its own lifetime -- ``ragpilot serve``
(the MCP server) chief among them, since the same query is often
repeated by different MCP clients/agents against one running server
(see the blueprint's own "CLI / MCP / agents / ChatGPT / Claude / Hermes"
example). Wired into ``retrieval/lexical.py``'s ``search_with_timings``
and ``retrieval/semantic.py``'s ``semantic_search``.

Invalidation is automatic rather than an explicit "clear" call: every
cache key embeds each searched project's on-disk database identity and
its SQLite ``PRAGMA data_version`` -- a free, O(1) built-in counter that
changes whenever that database file is committed to by a *different*
connection (every ``ragpilot index``/MCP-tool-call/daemon pass opens its
own fresh connection, so this reliably fires across processes and
across each MCP tool call's own fresh ``AppContext``). A cache entry
keyed on a since-changed data_version simply never matches again; it
just ages out of the bounded LRU like any other cold entry, so there is
no separate invalidation path to keep in sync with every writer.

Known limitation, not exercised by any code path in this project today:
``PRAGMA data_version`` does not change for a write made by the *same*
connection that then re-reads it (only writes from other connections are
visible this way) -- safe for every current caller here, which always
either opens a fresh connection per call (MCP tools, CLI commands) or
never writes on the connection it searches with, but would need a
different signal for a hypothetical future long-lived process that both
indexes and serves searches on the same cached connection.
