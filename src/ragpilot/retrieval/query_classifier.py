"""Deterministic (no AI) query classification for ``ragpilot search``
(blueprint sections 4/6): what *shape* of query this is, and how much
confidence the lexical pass already found -- both purely a function of
the query text / lexical results already in hand, never a network call
or a model load, so calling this on every search is free.

Two independent, small pieces of information, each with exactly one
consumer:

* ``classify_query`` -- ``QueryKind`` is currently diagnostic-only (see
  ``ragpilot search --explain``), a first step toward the blueprint's
  full per-kind strategy routing (section 4) without yet rewiring which
  strategies ``retrieval/lexical.py`` runs for which kind.
* ``estimate_confidence`` -- ``SearchConfidence`` is what ``cli/search.py``
  uses to decide whether semantic search is worth running at all, when
  ``search.lazy_semantic`` is on (blueprint sections 18/19).
