"""Polling-based change detection for network/UNC source roots.

Native filesystem events (inotify/FSEvents/ReadDirectoryChangesW) are not
reliably delivered across a network mount, so these sources are
fingerprinted (path -> (size, mtime), reusing ``sources.scanner.scan``'s
traversal, ignore rules and offline check) on a fixed interval instead of
watched -- see ``core.config.IndexingConfig.network_poll_seconds``.
