"""Collapses a burst of repeated per-key notifications into one trigger,
fired a quiet period after the *last* notification for that key.

Reuses ``indexing.debounce_ms`` (Phase 1's config field) as its quiet
period rather than adding a parallel setting -- there is exactly one
"how long to wait for a burst of writes to settle" knob in RAGpilot,
whether the burst came from a local watchdog event or a network poll
tick; see ``watcher/local.py`` and ``service/daemon.py``.

    Each ``notify(key)`` call (re)starts a ``quiet_ms``-long timer for
    that key; a key's ``on_fire`` callback runs only once a full quiet
    period has passed with no further ``notify`` for it -- so N rapid
    writes to the same file collapse into exactly one trigger, while
    events for *different* keys never interfere with each other's timer.

    Threading: both the local (watchdog) and network watchers deliver
    events from background threads, so every method here must be safe to
    call concurrently with the ``threading.Timer`` callbacks it starts.
