"""``ragpilot rebuild``: wipe one or every source's derived ``knowledge.db``
and re-index it from scratch.

The blueprint's disaster-recovery principle made concrete: "source files
= truth, RAGpilot DB = rebuildable derived state." If a project's
``knowledge.db`` is damaged, or a clean rebuild is just wanted, this
deletes that database (source files on disk are never touched) and runs
the exact same per-source indexing pass ``ragpilot index`` and the Phase
7 daemon already use (``indexing/runner.py``'s ``run_source_pass``) --
this module is deliberately thin, a "delete then reuse the existing
pipeline" wrapper rather than a second indexer.
