"""``ragpilot upgrade``: explicit, backup-first orchestration of the
existing migration system across ``sources.db`` and every registered
project's ``knowledge.db``.

This does not reimplement migration application -- ``storage/
migrations.py``'s ``apply_migrations`` already does that, idempotently,
on every ``AppContext.bootstrap()``/``project_conn()`` call. What this
command adds: check what is pending *before* anything is touched (using
raw, read-only connections -- going through ``AppContext.bootstrap()``
first would apply ``sources.db``'s migrations as a side effect and defeat
the "before" half of a before/after report), take an automatic backup
(reusing ``ops/backup.py`` rather than a second implementation) when a
schema-changing migration is about to run, then let the normal bootstrap
path apply it, and finally reuse ``ragpilot doctor``'s own health check
to report whether the result looks healthy.

No automatic rollback: a full, safe auto-rollback of an already-applied
SQLite schema migration (reversing arbitrary DDL, including additive
``ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN``, which SQLite cannot drop again before 3.35's
limited ``DROP COLUMN``) is a meaningfully separate and riskier feature
than this phase's priority (backup/restore/rebuild) warrants. The backup
taken above is the documented recovery path if ``healthy_after`` comes
back false: ``ragpilot restore <backup_archive>``.
