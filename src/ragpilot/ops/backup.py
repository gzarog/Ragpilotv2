"""``ragpilot backup``: an online, consistent snapshot of every database
RAGpilot maintains, packaged into one restorable archive.

Contains: ``sources.db``, every registered source's ``knowledge.db``, the
user config, and a manifest (RAGpilot version, per-database schema
version, timestamp, included sources/projects). Deliberately does NOT
contain the original source files -- those are the user's own data
elsewhere on disk and are the blueprint's source of truth; only
derived/registry state is backed up here. ``.tar.gz`` was chosen as the
archive format: it is a single file (easy to move/store), widely
supported, and compresses SQLite files (mostly-empty pages, repetitive
schema text) well without any RAGpilot-specific tooling required to
inspect it.
