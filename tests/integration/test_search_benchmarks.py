"""``pytest -m benchmark_search`` (blueprint section 35): generates a
synthetic corpus and runs the benchmark query set against it, printing a
latency report. Excluded from the default suite (see pyproject.toml's
``addopts``) since its numbers are only meaningful on real, unshared
hardware -- this test asserts the pipeline *runs correctly* (every
category finds its known fixture, hit counts are sane) rather than
hard-gating on the blueprint's millisecond targets, which a shared CI
runner cannot reliably meet or miss meaningfully.

Corpus size defaults to ``small`` (fast enough for routine use); set
``RAGPILOT_BENCHMARK_SIZE`` to run a larger one locally, e.g.::

    RAGPILOT_BENCHMARK_SIZE=medium pytest -m benchmark_search -q -s
